- # GITA FOR WOMEN

### **Timeless Original Stories**

## About us

Just earthlings exploring life in Swadharma and helping share what we've seen via stories, verse discussions, Q/A sessions and audio classes. 

Bhagavat Gita continues to guide us in daily life experiences, happy or tumultuous. It has shaped our personalities and we continue to grow _in_ its philosophy. 

## Aim

When asked why another talk over Gita or requirement of a podcast, the simplest reply has been _swantha sukhay (for own happiness)_. 

The very idea of being able to express thankfulness amd gratitude to the existence is sufficient to contribute to humanity by the medium of the Bhagavat Gita. 

## Inspiration for stories

Initially the thought hung upon interviews, but stories to tell something simple about life is always catchy even for an aged person helping immerse and be happy for a little while. Sometimes it also leaves a thought as a fodder remaining in mind subconsciously. Thinking, is important. 

Story building process is an enlightening one letting dwell in that verse deeply. By writing a story, writer also lives in Gita for that duration helping oneself introspect about own life and learnings. 

## Interviews

A very simple format and for which one can simply email us at gitaforwomen@gmail.com.
